# Relearn

This repository contains some game-playing algorithms developed during my (ongoing) study of
artificial intelligence.

The goal is to develop a framework containing interfaces where `Games` and `Players` implementations
can interact and experiment how different `Agents` algorithms fare, from classical to reinforcement
learning.
