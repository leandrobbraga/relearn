# Relearn

This repository contains some game-playing algorithms developed during my (ongoing) study of
artificial intelligence.

The goal is to develop a framework containing interfaces where `Games` and `Players` implementations
can interact and experiment how different `Agents` algorithms fare, from classical to reinforcement
learning.

## Usage

```shell
$ cargo run -r play min-max random 100
Win: 89.58%, Draw: 10.42%, Loss: 0.00%, Game Count: 96
```
